🧩 Tic-Tac-Toe (Java Console Game)

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game developed in Java, running in the console.
Two players (X and O) take turns selecting a position on a 3×3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

The project was developed as part of my Java learning journey, focusing on basic game logic, input handling, and clean code structure.
